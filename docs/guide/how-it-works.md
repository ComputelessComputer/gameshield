# How Gameshield Works

This page explains the technical architecture and operational flow of Gameshield's game-based CAPTCHA system.

## Architecture Overview

Gameshield consists of three main components:

1. **Client SDK**: A JavaScript library that renders the game interface and handles user interactions
2. **Game Engine**: A WebGL-powered engine that generates and runs the verification games
3. **Verification API**: A server-side component that validates the authenticity of completed challenges

## Verification Process

### 1. Challenge Generation

When a CAPTCHA is requested, the system:

- Generates a unique challenge ID
- Randomly selects a game type from the available options
- Creates game parameters with varying difficulty levels
- Applies randomization to prevent pattern recognition

### 2. User Interaction

The user is presented with an interactive game that requires human-like decision making and motor skills:

- Puzzle games require spatial reasoning
- Pattern recognition games test visual processing
- Timing-based games measure reaction time
- Physics-based games leverage intuitive understanding of motion

### 3. Behavior Analysis

During gameplay, the system analyzes multiple factors:

- Interaction patterns (mouse/touch movements)
- Timing of actions
- Decision-making process
- Solution approach

These factors are compared against known human behavior patterns to determine authenticity.

### 4. Token Generation

Upon successful completion:

- The client generates a cryptographically signed token
- This token contains the challenge ID, completion data, and a timestamp
- The token is passed to your application for server-side verification

### 5. Server Verification

For complete security, your server should:

- Send the token to Gameshield's verification API
- Receive confirmation of validity
- Process the user's request only after verification

## Security Measures

Gameshield employs multiple layers of security:

### Dynamic Challenges

Each game is uniquely generated with randomized parameters, making it impossible to create a database of solutions.

### Behavior Analysis

Beyond just completing the game, the system analyzes how the user interacts with the challenge, detecting automation attempts.

### Time-Limited Tokens

Verification tokens expire after a short period, preventing replay attacks.

### Server-Side Verification

All tokens must be verified on the server side, preventing client-side tampering.

### Continuous Learning

The system continuously improves by learning from new attack patterns and evolving its detection mechanisms.

## Performance Optimization

Gameshield is designed for minimal impact on user experience:

- Lightweight client SDK (<50KB gzipped)
- Efficient WebGL rendering
- Adaptive difficulty based on device capabilities
- Preloading of game assets during idle page time
