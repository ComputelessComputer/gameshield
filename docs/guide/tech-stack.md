## Architecture

### System Architecture

The GameShield system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### SDK Architecture

The CaptchaSDK follows a modular design pattern:

### Analytics Architecture

The analytics system follows a provider pattern for flexibility:

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend application is built with Next.js and includes:

- **Public Website**: Information about GameShield and documentation
- **Demo Page**: Interactive demonstration of the CAPTCHA
- **Admin Dashboard**: Analytics and monitoring interface

Key features of the frontend:

- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and performance
- Static site generation for documentation pages
- Client-side rendering for interactive components
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### CaptchaSDK

The CaptchaSDK is the core package that provides CAPTCHA functionality:

- Written in TypeScript for type safety
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Supports multiple game types and difficulty levels
- Includes built-in analytics and security features

### Game Core

The game core is responsible for:

- Generating random game challenges
- Rendering game elements on HTML5 Canvas
- Handling user interactions
- Validating game completion
- Collecting interaction metrics for security analysis

### Analytics System

The analytics system provides:

- Collection of verification metrics
- Detection of malicious behavior
- Storage of analytics data (via provider pattern)
- Calculation of statistics and trends
- API for retrieving analytics data

### Security Features

Security is a core focus of GameShield:

- Token-based verification
- Browser fingerprinting
- Behavior analysis to detect bots
- Risk scoring for suspicious activity
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## Build and Deployment

### Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Clone repository and install dependencies with `pnpm install`
2. **Development**: Run `pnpm dev` to start development servers
3. **Testing**: Run `pnpm test` to execute test suites
4. **Building**: Run `pnpm build` to build all packages and apps
5. **Documentation**: Run `pnpm docs:dev` to start documentation server

### Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

- Automated testing on pull requests
- Linting and type checking
- Build verification
- Documentation generation

### Deployment

The project can be deployed in various ways:

- **SDK**: Published to npm for easy installation
- **Frontend**: Deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or other hosting services
- **Documentation**: Deployed as static site to GitHub Pages

## Future Technical Roadmap

Planned technical improvements:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize game rendering and load times
2. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve support for screen readers and keyboard navigation
3. **Advanced Security**: Implement machine learning for better bot detection
4. **Mobile Support**: Enhance touch interactions for mobile devices
5. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages
6. **Server-side SDK**: Create server implementations for popular frameworks
