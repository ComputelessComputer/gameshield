## Analytics System

### Data Collection
The analytics system automatically collects:
- Verification attempts
- Success/failure events
- Completion times
- Risk indicators
- User behavior patterns

### Provider Options

#### LocalStorage Provider
- Built-in solution for demos
- No external dependencies
- Limited data retention

#### Custom Provider
Implement your own provider by:
1. Creating a class implementing `AnalyticsProvider` interface
2. Configuring the provider in the admin settings
3. Managing data storage and retrieval

```typescript
interface AnalyticsProvider {
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  trackEvent(eventName: string, data: any): void;
  getMetrics(): Promise<AnalyticsMetrics>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Check verification trends daily
   - Review malicious activity alerts
   - Adjust security thresholds as needed

2. **Data Management**
   - Configure appropriate retention periods
   - Export important data regularly
   - Back up custom provider data

3. **Security**
   - Regularly rotate admin credentials
   - Monitor API access patterns
   - Review security logs
