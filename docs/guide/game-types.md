# Game Types

Gameshield offers a variety of game types to provide both security and accessibility. Each game type is designed to be easy for humans but challenging for bots.

## Available Game Types

### Puzzle Slider üß©

**Description**: A classic sliding puzzle where users must arrange tiles to complete an image.

**How it works**:
- A complete image is divided into a grid of tiles (typically 3x3 or 4x4)
- One tile is removed, creating an empty space
- Tiles adjacent to the empty space can be moved into it
- The user must arrange the tiles to form the complete image

**Security features**:
- Each puzzle is randomly generated with different images
- The solution requires spatial reasoning and planning
- The system tracks natural movement patterns during solving

**Accessibility**: Moderate - requires visual recognition and spatial reasoning

### Pattern Matching üîç

**Description**: Users must identify and select elements that match a specific pattern or category.

**How it works**:
- A set of visual elements is displayed (shapes, icons, etc.)
- The user must select all elements that match a given criteria
- Criteria might include "select all red items" or "select items in a specific order"

**Security features**:
- Patterns and criteria are randomly generated
- The system analyzes selection timing and accuracy
- Multiple valid solutions with varying efficiency

**Accessibility**: High - can be adapted for color blindness and other visual impairments

### Maze Navigation üåÄ

**Description**: Users guide an object through a randomly generated maze.

**How it works**:
- A procedurally generated maze is displayed
- Users must navigate from start to finish by drawing a path
- Obstacles and dead ends create complexity

**Security features**:
- Each maze is uniquely generated
- The system analyzes path efficiency and correction patterns
- Speed and accuracy metrics help identify automated attempts

**Accessibility**: Moderate - requires fine motor control

### Physics Puzzles ‚öñÔ∏è

**Description**: Users solve simple physics-based challenges that require intuitive understanding of physical properties.

**How it works**:
- Objects with physical properties (gravity, collision, etc.) are presented
- Users must interact with these objects to achieve a goal
- Examples include stacking blocks, balancing objects, or directing a ball to a target

**Security features**:
- Challenges leverage human intuitive understanding of physics
- The system analyzes interaction patterns and solution approach
- Multiple valid solutions with varying efficiency

**Accessibility**: Moderate to High - intuitive and adaptable

### Sequence Memory üî¢

**Description**: Users must remember and reproduce a sequence of events.

**How it works**:
- A sequence of visual or audio cues is presented
- Users must reproduce the sequence in the correct order
- Difficulty scales with sequence length and complexity

**Security features**:
- Sequences are randomly generated
- The system analyzes timing between inputs
- Pattern recognition that's natural for humans but difficult for bots

**Accessibility**: Variable - can be adapted for different abilities (visual, audio, etc.)

## Game Selection Algorithm

Gameshield uses a smart selection algorithm to determine which game to present to each user:

1. **Device Detection**: Identifies the user's device type and capabilities
2. **Accessibility Awareness**: Considers any detected accessibility tools
3. **Progressive Challenge**: Starts with simpler games and increases difficulty if suspicious behavior is detected
4. **Rotation Strategy**: Varies game types to prevent learning attacks

## Customization Options

You can customize which games appear in your integration:

```javascript
import { generateCaptcha } from '@gameshield/captcha-sdk';

generateCaptcha({
  container: document.getElementById('captcha-container'),
  gameTypes: ['puzzle', 'pattern', 'maze'], // Only use these game types
  preferredGameType: 'pattern', // Try to use this game type when possible
  excludeGameTypes: ['physics'], // Never use these game types
});
```

## Next Steps
