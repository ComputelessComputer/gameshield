# Pattern Game

A memory and observation challenge where players must recreate specific visual patterns.

## Game Mechanics
- Observe displayed patterns
- Memorize sequence and positions
- Recreate patterns accurately
- Complete within time limit

## Configuration

```typescript
const captcha = new CaptchaSDK({
  gameType: 'pattern',
  difficulty: 'medium',
  config: {
    gridSize: 4,
    displayTime: 2000,
    patternLength: 5
  }
});
```

### Parameters
- `gridSize`: Size of the pattern grid (3-5)
- `displayTime`: Pattern display duration in ms (1000-3000)
- `patternLength`: Number of cells in pattern (3-9)

## Difficulty Levels

### Easy
- Small grid size (3x3)
- Longer display time
- Simple patterns
- Multiple attempts allowed

### Medium
- Standard grid size (4x4)
- Balanced display time
- Mixed complexity patterns
- Limited attempts

### Hard
- Large grid size (5x5)
- Short display time
- Complex patterns
- Single attempt only

## Security Features
- Input timing analysis
- Pattern recreation accuracy
- Anti-automation measures
- Memory test verification

## Accessibility
- High contrast patterns
- Audio pattern cues
- Adjustable timing
- Touch/mouse input support
