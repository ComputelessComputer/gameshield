# Gameshield - Generative Game CAPTCHA

> Inspired by [Guillermo Rauch](https://x.com/rauchg)'s [Doom CAPTCHA](https://doom-captcha.vercel.app)

## Overview

Gameshield is an innovative, open-source CAPTCHA system designed to prevent web crawling and bot interactions using interactive, randomly generated games. Unlike traditional CAPTCHA methods, which rely on text-based or image recognition challenges, this approach leverages generative games that require real-time human interaction to verify authenticity.

## Features

- 🎮 Interactive Generative Games: Unique mini-games that adapt dynamically.
- 🔒 Enhanced Security: Resistant to automated solvers and AI-based attacks.
- 🖥️ Easy Integration: Framework-agnostic Web Components for any tech stack.
- 🌍 Accessible: Designed to be user-friendly and inclusive.
- 🚀 Optimized for Performance: Runs efficiently in both browser and mobile environments.
- 🧠 Behavior Analysis: Advanced detection of human vs bot interaction patterns.
- 🔐 Token-based Verification: Secure JWT tokens for server-side validation.

## Monorepo Structure

This project follows a monorepo architecture using Turborepo + pnpm for efficient package management.
